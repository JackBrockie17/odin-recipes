# odin-recipes

This project is a basic HTML website which includes several different food recipes. 
The aim of this project is to familiarise myself with the basics of HTML, including basic text elements like <p>, <h> <ul>/<ol>, <strong>, <em>, comments as well as links and images with <a> and <img> and attributes like href, alt and src. 
Another aim of the project is to familiarise me with using Git and Github, knowing the basic syntax like add, commit, push and writing effective commit messages. 

The project is currently only coded with HTML, however, as per The Odin Project curriculum it will later be styled with CSS.

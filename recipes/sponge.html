    <h3>Description</h3>
    <P>Victoria sponge cake, a much loved English layer cake, is perfect for any occasion! This foolproof recipe sandwiches two tender cakes with a layer of strawberry jam and buttercream, but you can use sweetened whipped cream. Dust the top of the cake with confectioners' sugar for a beautiful presentation.</P>
